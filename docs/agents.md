# Services

This document describes the services and agents used in the My Electron Peek AI project.

## Overview

The services layer provides business logic, API interactions, and data management utilities. Services are organized in the `src/lib/services/` directory and follow a modular architecture for maintainability and testability.

## Current Services

### Example Service (`exampleService.ts`)

A placeholder service demonstrating the service architecture pattern.

**Features:**

- Basic data retrieval methods
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Modular export structure

**Usage:**

```typescript
import { exampleService } from '../lib/services';

// Use the service
const data = exampleService.getData();
```

## Service Architecture

### Design Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: The application uses **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling and **Ant Design** for consistent, accessible UI components. Services can integrate with these UI technologies to provide seamless user experiences.
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces
- **Modularity**: Each service is self-contained with clear responsibilities
- **Testability**: Services can be easily unit tested in isolation

### File Structure

```text
src/lib/services/
├── index.ts              # Main service exports
├── exampleService.ts     # Individual service implementations
└── [future-services].ts  # Additional services
```

### Service Interface Pattern

Each service follows a consistent interface pattern:

```typescript
interface ServiceName {
  methodName(params: ParamType): ReturnType;
}

export const serviceName: ServiceName = {
  methodName: (params) => {
    // Implementation
  }
};
```

## Planned Services

### AI Service

- AI model integration
- Prompt management
- Response processing

### Data Service

- Local data persistence
- Configuration management
- Cache management

### API Service

- External API communications
- Authentication handling
- Error management

## Configuration

Services can be configured through environment variables or configuration files:

- Development: Local configuration
- Production: Environment-specific settings
- Testing: Mock implementations

## Error Handling

Services implement consistent error handling patterns:

- Custom error types for different failure scenarios
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Logging for debugging and monitoring

## Testing

Services are designed for comprehensive testing:

- Unit tests for individual methods
- Integration tests for service interactions
- Mock implementations for isolated testing
